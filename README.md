# Circle Area Calculator

This repository contains a basic Java program that calculates the area of a circle. The program uses a hard-coded value for the radius (`5.0`), applies the formula $A = \pi \cdot r^2$, and then prints the result to the console in square centimeters.

This is a great example for learning how to use constants (`final double PI`), declare variables, and perform basic mathematical operations in Java.
